# Conway's Game of Life

A version of Conway's Game of Life implemented using the ncurses library, so as a result, it doesn't run on windows at the moment.

Runs in terminal of any size and randomly places predefined shapes in the map at each startup. Supports basic functionallity like pausing.

To use it yourself, just run `cmake` to generate a makefile and `make` to to compile the code!
